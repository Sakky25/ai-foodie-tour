# 🍽️ AI Foodie Tour Workflow – Built with Julep

## 🎯 Goal
Generate a personalized foodie tour across cities using weather data, local cuisine, restaurant ratings, and LLM-powered storytelling.

## 🧠 Workflow Steps
1. **City Input** – Start with a list of cities.
2. **Weather Fetch** – Calls OpenWeatherMap to get current weather.
3. **Indoor/Outdoor Decision** – Uses LLM to recommend dining style.
4. **Iconic Dishes** – Prompts AI to suggest 3 local must-eat dishes.
5. **Top Restaurants** – Uses Google Places/Yelp API to find top-rated spots for each dish.
6. **Narrative Tour Creation** – AI crafts an immersive story for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
7. **Final Output** – Collated into a single beautiful summary per city.

## ⚙️ APIs Used
- OpenWeatherMap (Free tier)
- Google Places or Yelp Fusion (Free tier)
- LLM prompts via Julep's built-in model
- No external key needed inside Julep workflow

## 💡 Off-Script Idea
If time allows, I’ll add an **emoji-based mood meter** for each tour and recommend a **dessert detour** optionally based on cuisine type.

## 🚀 Demo
Coming soon! I’m hosting the results as a Julep public workflow. [Link Placeholder]
